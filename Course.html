                <p style="color: black;">eLearning works because it provides teachers with a roadmap to teach and engages students with activity-based lessons. We've learned through research that technology alone is not enough. Delivering quality education requires all aspects
                    of a school to work in sync. Impact Network developed the eSchool 360 model to maximize the potential benefits of eLearning in the most remote, under-served areas of Africa.We believe education is a combination of an effective curriculum

            <h4>IMPACT EDUCATION</h4>
            <p style="color: black;">We envision a world where all students are given the tools they need to reach their full potential. We have developed an effective education platform for rural communities to provide a model for developing countries. With the school as a starting
                point, we are able to make broad changes across families and communities to improve not only their educational outcomes, but also their overall wellbeing. We believe education is a combination of an effective curriculum (supported by Mwabu),
                a robust teaching and coaching model and supplemental programs around health, child protection, and environmental sustainability.Primary and secondary school age children in the poorest countries are nine times more likely to be out of
                school than those in the richest countries. While primary school enrollment is high, education quality is low, and literacy rates among young adults fall under regional averages. The average scores on the 2016 Grade 5 National Assessment
                were 35% in English and 37% in math, and little progress has been made on academic performance since 1999. Despite decades of peace and stability, the Zambian educational system is providing neither the access to nor the quality of education
                that its citizens demand. We believe education is a combination of an effective curriculum (supported by Mwabu), a robust teaching and coaching model and supplemental programs around health, child protection, and environmental sustainability.
